    <p>I know it might sound a bit cliché, but I genuinely love working with computers. There's something incredibly satisfying about building them from the 
        ground up—though, let's be real, the cost of keeping up with that passion can be a bit much! I also get a kick out of connecting computers over networks, 
        almost like solving a digital jigsaw puzzle. I thrive on finding creative solutions to complex problems, and if I can make someone's day a little easier 
        by helping them out, that's the cherry on top!</p>
    <p>p.s. I am a marathon runner.</p>
